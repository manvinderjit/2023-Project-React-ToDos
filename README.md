# A ToDO App Created with React

This project was created to enable users to add, edit, delete, and change the status of notes.

## Objectives

The project has been created with `legacy React Classes` to exhibit ability to work with legacy React codebases.

## Future Changes

### 1. Update Code Base

App makes use of the CRA framework for REACT. It will be refactored into Vite in the future for enhanced security.

### 2. Persistent Storage:

App currently stores the data in a state variable which resets when the page is refreshed(re-rendered). Database storage will be added in the future.

### 3. User Authentication and Authorization

App presently lacks any user authentication or authorization. They will be added to control access to persistent storage data.


### 4. Functional Components

A variant of the app will be created with functional components that may be integrated along with a weather app. The product will allow users to fetch weather data and save todos upon login.
